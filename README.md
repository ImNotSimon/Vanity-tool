Source code of GUID_Corrector that comes prepackaged with releases (and is required for Vanity to run properly): https://github.com/ImNotSimon/Vanity-GUIDcorrector

Note: Vanity, to run properly and as intended from compiled source, needs to have the "AssetRipper.Settings.json" file found in the root directory of this repository alongside "Vanity.GUI.exe" due to how AssetRipper works in terms of settings.
